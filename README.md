# appointment
The goal of this area is to create several web pages with a login form and an appointment page for Glia's scheduled appointment use case.  In explaining the use case to Apple FCU, we need to show what the web pages could be, how they would be set up, and how Glia interacts with the information.<br>
Steve to use this as a learning project, Rob to learn as well.<br><br>

appointmentlogin.html - form with login page, passes name and email over to appointment.html<br><br>
appointment.html - page where the Glia script will be installed. Glia will read the name and email address from the form, passed through, and populate that info in Glia.
