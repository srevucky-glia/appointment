# appointment
The goal of this area is to create several web pages with a login form and an appointment page for Glia's scheduled appointment use case.  In explaining the use case to Apple FCU, we need to show what the web pages could be, how they would be set up, and how Glia interacts with the information.
Steve to use this as a learning project, Rob to learn as well.
